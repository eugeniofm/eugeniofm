publication: Adaptation and Training Effects from a Passive, Wearable Resistance Device During Exercise
publication_short: 

abstract: Wearable technology's integration into exercise regimens has enhanced human motor capabilities and rehabilitation. This study examines the motor learning impact of a passive Wearable Resistance (WR) device with elastic bands that produce force fields in response to body movement. A method for characterizing the device's forces was developed and used in an experimental study assessing its effect on squat form compared to visual or no feedback. The WR device demonstrated potential for improving squat form consistency and reducing cross-body asymmetry, offering insights into passive resistance's role in motor learning and exercise.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Investigating passive force fields in motor learning and squat performance.
